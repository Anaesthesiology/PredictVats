Statistical code supporting the manuscript: "Predictors of acute postoperative pain in cancer patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery â€“ an exploratory study".

The initial redCAP database was partially coded in Danish, and some phrases were not changed to english before data was added and could therefore not be translated. Therefore, some parts of the code is in danish, but comments have been made to make the code easier to read for non-danish speakers. Should any names be unintuitive, please contact corresponding author Phillip K Sperling (phis@rn.dk) or post an issue to the repository.

The repository includes 5 documents:
- Preprocess: File for processing raw data until analysis. 
- Statistics: The statistical analysis code for the project
- Flowchart: Code for making figure 1
- Estimation_of_sample_size: samlpe sice calculation
- TNM Coding: An image of the variables used for coding tnm stage in the main statistics code.
